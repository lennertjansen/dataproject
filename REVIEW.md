## Code review by Jitse Schol

### Levels
comments: 3 (comments are clear when the are present, but they need to appear more consistently)
names: 4 (good choice of variable and function names, little to no room for improvement)

formatting: 3 (indentation and spacing is generally good, some minor inconsistencies have been observed)
organization: 4 (little to no room for improvement, functionality is grouped into concise and clear parts)

flow: 2 (the order in which functions appear is not yet as logical as it should be)
idiom: 4 (clear and appropriate use of libraries and functions)

structure: 3 (modules are reasonably compact, room for improvement though. Clear use of functions, but they can be shortened.)


### Remarks by Jitse:
Remove code that has been commented out.
Avoid using inline comments.
Add more comments, especially to the recently written blocks of code.
Review whether or not you are consistent in your spacing (i.e., spaces between operators and white lines).
Make sure the flow (i.e., order) of your code is logical.
