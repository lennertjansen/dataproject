### Process

## DISCLAIMER
I only realized I was required to document my process in this file at the end of Week 2. So I have summarized my progress of the first two weeks and started documenting my daily progress as of Week 3.

# Week 1 Summary

Was inspired by the idea of doing visualizations on tennis data as I am a big fan of tennis and I stumbled upon an ATP data-set on Kaggle.

Worked out some sketches of which visualizations I was considering (barchart, piechart, probability distribution, tree diagram, etc.)

Considered topics to discuss using my visualizations (grand slam performance)

Started harvesting and manipulating the data into a usable form for my project.

# Week 2 Summary

Continued data manipulation well into Week 2.

# Monday, June 18th
Finished fine tuning the collapsible tree-diagram, which can now also be rendered by searching for a player in the search bar.

Made a very basic link between the dropdown menu and the barchart.

# Tuesday, June 19th
Managed to link the barchart and piechart

Figuring out how to link the tree nodes with the barchart

# Wednesday, June 20th
Added animation to donut chart.

Worked out the connectivity between collapsible tree and barchart. All three visualisations are now connected

# Thursday, June 21st
Added option to look up random tennis player.

Started adding titles and story telling elements.

Considering adding a question-mark icon with a tooltip that appears when hovering over said icon containing information on the usage of my visualizations. But for now I'll write this information in story.html

# Friday, June 22nd
Had my weekly walkthrough with Tim and discussed further additions to be made to my project, as well as bugs in needs of removal.

The search bar will be implemented such that upon typing a part of a name, a list of names starting with the typed letters appear for the user to select from.
This was advised by Tim, as not all users can be expected to know full names of tennis players by heart.

Furthermore, I will be adding small question-mark icons which display a tutorial-like tooltip once hovered on.

# Saturday, June 23rd
Started implementing the autocomplete function of the search bar using a W3 School tutorial.

Commenced cleaning my code in preparation of final deadline.

Started writing the structure of my final report in LaTeX. https://www.sharelatex.com/project/5b2e390491d4e20d3fe61db9

# Sunday, June 24th
Completed implementation of autocomplete functionality

# Monday, June 25th
Working out some bugs in the autocomplete search-bar.

Finished the summarized version of the donut chart.

# Tuesday, June 26th
Fixed the bugs in the div placement. The visualisations no longer jump from location to location upon updating them.

Started adding question mark icons which will display a usage-manual when hovered over by the user.

Fixing the title and legend placement.

# Wednesday, June 27th
Added a dropdown menu to the piechart, giving the user the option to pick the number of slices.

Finished writing report.

Did a code review with Jitse Schol.

Worked out a bug in the searchbar.

Finished the placement of the respective div-elements.

Finalized the titles, legends, and help tooltips.
