### Final Project (MPROG)

Name: Lennert Jansen
Student number: 10488952

## Project Proposal – Programming Project, June 2018

# Problem statement

The Association of Tenis Professionals (ATP) oversees a large number of yearly tournaments between an even greater number of tennis players, resulting in a sea of data and statistics regarding matches, rankings, player statistics (e.g. height, handedness, nationality, etc.). This abundance of information makes for difficult interpretation of statistics and detection of patterns.  

# Solution

My proposal for the final project constitutes a number of linked (interactive) visualizations on player- and match-statistics in the ATP. With these visualizations, I aim to clarify patterns and relationships found within the data (e.g. which country produces the most Grand Slam winners? Does left handedness increase one’s probability of winning a match? Etc.)

** I plan to focus on Grand Slam tournaments, exclusively, in order to avoid intolerable computation times.

# Prerequisites

External components: D3.js, d3-tip

Hardest part: I expect the majority of technical difficulty to arise from data preprocessing and manipulation for a couple for reasons. Firstly, I’m planning on making rather simple and straight forward charts (i.e., bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs) as the complexity of the data does not call for more complex visualizations. Secondly, the size of the four csv-files is rather large, and they are very unbalanced. So I suspect it will take me a good amount of time to prepare the data for visualization and analysis.
