#### Introduction and description of the ATP Match Data Visualizations
Three interactive and linked visualizations constitute the application in question; a collapsible tree diagram or dendrogram, a bar chart and a pie chart or donut chart.
The main goal of this project is to visually represent tennis player's statistics using the aforementioned chart-types. The dendrogram is an interactive visualization that serves as a player's profile containing both personal information (i.e. height, nationality and handedness), and three match based statistics. The bar chart in the lower right corner of the screen depict the selected player's performance at the four ATP Grand Slam tournaments (The Australian Open, Roland Garros (The French Open), The Championships Wimbledon and The US Open). Finally, the donut chart, situated in the lower left corner of the screen illustrates the match winning rates of various nationalities at a selected Grand Slam tournament.
