        <h1> Why tennis data? </h1>
        <p>
            As a child, I grew up playing tennis and fanatically watching Grand Slam matches regularly with my family.
            So, when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sijovm/atpdata">the ATP Matches, 1968 to 2017 dataset on Kaggle</a> I was instantly interested.
            The dataset encompasses match data regarding EVERY ATP tour tennis match from 1968 to 2017. As one can imagine, this posed as an obstacle.
            Due to the unreasonably large amount of computation time required to process the data, I decided to limit myself to Grand Slam matches between 1995 and 2016.
            So, it must be kept in mind when interpretating the graphs that some statistics  contain discrepancies on a player's performance, as some player's careers exceed the span of 1995 to 2016 (e.g., Pete Sampras).
        </p>

        <h1> Using the visualisations </h1>
        <h4>The search bar </h4>
        <p>
            Everything starts at the search bar. Here, you can enter a desired player's first and last name (case unsensitive), or simply type "random" and render the first diagram.
        </p>

        <h4> Collapsible Tree Diagram (dendrogram) </h4>
        <p>
            Upon searching a (random) player a tennis-ball-like icon (node) appears, from which two links extend. Each of these links end in nodes, which when clicked on, extend into even more nodes!
            The upper half of the fully extended dendrogram contains the player's personal information, i.e., nationality, height and handedness.
            Whereas the lower three end nodes contain performance statistics calculated from the extensive dataset.
            The lower three end nodes (match statistics) update the bar chart below when clicked on.
        </p>
        <h4> The Grand Slam Bar Chart </h4>
        <p>
            A bar chart appears below the dendrogram, containing information on a selected player's performance at the four grand slams (in order of occurrence in a year).
            The contents of said bar chart can be updated in two ways: by clicking on the aforementioned end-nodes in the dendrogram, or by selecting the statistic of interest in the dropdown menu in the upper left corner.
            Furthermore, when one of the bar's is clicked, the donut chart is rendered.
        </p>
        <h4> The Donut Chart </h4>
        <p>
            An interesting comparison might be how players of different nationalities perform at a specific grand slam (on average). Hence, the donut chart.
            This chart depicts the average performance statistic of a certain nationality (determined by IOC codes) at a specific grand slam.
