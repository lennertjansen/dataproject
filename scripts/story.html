        <h1> Why tennis data? </h1>
            <p>
                As a child, I grew up playing tennis and fanatically watching Grand Slam matches regularly with my family.
                So, when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sijovm/atpdata">the ATP Matches, 1968 to 2017 dataset on Kaggle</a> I was instantly interested.
                The dataset encompasses match data regarding EVERY ATP tour tennis match from 1968 to 2017. As one can imagine, this posed as an obstacle.
                Due to the unreasonably large amount of computation time required to process the data, I decided to limit myself to Grand Slam matches between 1995 and 2016.
                So, it must be kept in mind when interpretating the graphs that some statistics  contain discrepancies on a player's performance, as some player's careers exceed the span of 1995 to 2016 (e.g., Pete Sampras).
            </p>

        <h1> Using the visualisations </h1>
            <h4>The search bar </h4>
                <p>
                    Everything starts at the search bar. Here, you can enter a desired player's first and last name (case unsensitive), or simply type "random" and render the first diagram.
                </p>

            <h4> Collapsible Tree Diagram (dendrogram) </h4>
                <p>
                    Upon searching a (random) player a tennis-ball-like icon (node) appears, from which two links extend. Each of these links end in nodes, which when clicked on, extend into even more nodes!
                    The upper half of the fully extended dendrogram contains the player's personal information, i.e., nationality, height and handedness.
                    Whereas the lower three end nodes contain performance statistics calculated from the extensive dataset.
                    The lower three end nodes (match statistics) update the bar chart below when clicked on.
                </p>
            <h4> The Grand Slam Bar Chart </h4>
                <p>
                    A bar chart appears below the dendrogram, containing information on a selected player's performance at the four grand slams (in order of occurrence in a year).
                    The contents of said bar chart can be updated in two ways: by clicking on the aforementioned end-nodes in the dendrogram, or by selecting the statistic of interest in the dropdown menu in the upper left corner.
                    Furthermore, when one of the bar's is clicked, the donut chart is rendered.
                </p>
            <h4> The Donut Chart </h4>
                <p>
                    An interesting comparison might be how players of different nationalities perform at a specific grand slam (on average). Hence, the donut chart.
                    This chart depicts the average performance statistic of a certain nationality (determined by IOC codes) at a specific grand slam.
                </p>

        <h1> The story and interesting observations </h1>
            <p>
                The aim of my application is to visually represent some well-known aspects of a tennismatch. Starting with the most evident one: making a lot of double faults in a game decrease you're chances of winning a game.
                Losing points by making double faults means you're losing points in you're own turn to serve, which typically has the greatest probability of being you're wining game, as you get to be the first player to set the pace of the game.
                Thus, a recurring pattern is seeing players with high average numbers of double faults having low match winning rates, and vice versa.
                <br></br>
                The exact opposite relationship holds for the number of aces players make. Namely, scoring a lot of aces in a game significantly increases your chances of winning that game and therefore the match.
                However, this pattern is a lot less clear in the bar charts, as it is often expected that a player wins their serve game. This justifies the well-known saying in tennis "Tennis is a game of errors".
                Meaning that players who make few errors are players who win matches.
                <br></br>
                Take a look, for instance, at the double fault rates of players like Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andre Agassi and other greats. They all seem to have low double fault rates, accompanied by high match winning rates.
                <br></br>
                Finally, my visualizations also set out to debunk the theory of homefield advantages, a phenomenon observed in many teamsports. The donut chart clearly depicts how there seems to be no overlap between the nationalities of single succesful players and the top performing nationalities.
                Furthermore, players who share nationalities with the hosting country of a Grand Slam seem to have no advantage based on their country of origin.
